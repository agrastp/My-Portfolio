# My-Portfolio


## Description

This is my working portfolio all about me, links to my work, and how to contact me.This project motivated me as a future developer in researching and learning more about different key elements of CSS.  There were many hours of exploration, experimentation, and research to work on getting my website working correctly.  This project also allowed me to understand areas I need to work on more in order for me to create better working sites.

## Usage

This project will be the start to my future portfolio when I am job searching.  It can be used as a great starting point with many areas that can be developed and changed over the coming months.
